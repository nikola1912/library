This is a simple library in which you can add books you've read or plan to read. It helped me understand objects better and how to interact with them. Also it helped me understand form alot better and how I can manipulate information using them.

I plan on adding a card styled view in which books are represented by their book cover including information about them.

When you open it you'll see some books are already present. That is so you can see how the app looks and try the buttons.
